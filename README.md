# nwen304 project 2

Very simple quote node.js server that allows users to add and retrieve quotes using a simple RESTful interface.

Includes html for the client as well as the code for the server side.

This was modified by John Armstrong (for project 2 NWEN304 2015) to use a postgresql database.
